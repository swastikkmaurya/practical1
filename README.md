Aim
To explore Python programming fundamentals, focusing on variables and the print() function for output display.

Theory
Python stands as a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented language known for its simplicity and broad applications in software development, data science, and task automation.
Variables in Python store data values without needing prior declaration—they form automatically upon assignment. The language handles various data types, including strings, integers, and floats.
The print() function outputs information to the screen, allowing multiple items to be displayed by separating them with commas. This lab introduces essential Python syntax, variable usage, and basic output methods.

Conclusion (Experiment 1: Introduction to Python)
This experiment effectively covered Python’s foundational elements. Proficiency in variables and the print() function was achieved, building a solid base in Python syntax for developing straightforward programs.
